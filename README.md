# jsExercises for May 5th 2016
Today you will be completing exercises `array-exercises.js` and `for-loop-exercises.js`.

When you think you have completed the function correctly, open `index.html` and preview the file in Cloud9.
`index.html` validates your code and will point out errors if it finds them.
If the test is all green then your function is correct!

## We Do
First, we need to check out the project.

* On this page, click **Fork** in the top right to get your own copy
* Then open up Cloud9. Go to Respositories, find **jsExercises-May5-2016** and click **Clone to edit**.
* Name the Workspace as **jsexercises-may5-2016**, leave all other settings as default and click **Create workspace**.
* Open `array-exercises.js` in your project workspace.

You will notice that the function `example()` is already created for in `array-exercises.js` and `for-loop-exercises.js`.
These example functions will serve as hints on how to complete the rest of the functions.

## You Do
Complete all exercises in `array-exercises.js` then work on `for-loop-exercises.js`.
Remember **if you get stuck, ask for help from a mentor!**
